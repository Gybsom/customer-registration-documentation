## About the project

This project aims to structure a tutorial on how a company can register their customers on a platform.

For this case, 3 sections were created to contextualize the information of this feature. In the Guide section, we will describe the steps to create and activate the customer. The API Reference section addresses the details on how to integrate using the APIs. Finally, the Changelog describes the highlights of this feature.
